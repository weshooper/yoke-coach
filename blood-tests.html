    <h2>Blood tests</h2>

    <p>I find the following blood tests useful every 9-12 months:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Testosterone (free or unbound)</li>
      <li>HbA1c (diabetes risk)</li>
      <li>CRP (high sensitivity)</li>
      <li>Cholesterol (lipid profile)</li>
      <li>Liver profile</li>
      <li>Vitamin D</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may already have some or all of these results recently, so it’s always worth asking your GP to share existing results first.</p>

    <p>If not, they <em>should</em> be able to arrange them for you – though this can depend on the GP practise, your ability to get across the importance of a proactive approach to healthcare, and/or whether you’ve any existing health conditions.</p>

    <p>As a last resort – or to save yourself some time – I’ve used a private blood testing company in the past, and found it simple and easy to do. The company, Thriva, currently have a 20% off promotion, when you subscribe to their newsletter. Or, if you <a href="https://thriva.co/i/LDYX3BJ8D4A">use this link</a> we both get £20 off our tests. Use whichever gets you the best discount!</p>

    <p>To learn why the above tests are useful, Thriva have a <a href="https://thriva.co/blood-test-packages/mens-health-blood-test">men’s health package</a> that gives an overview of each, along with further details.</p>
