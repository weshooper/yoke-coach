    <h2>Blood tests</h2>

    <p>You may already have some or all of these results recently, so it’s always worth asking your GP first. If not, they <em>should</em> be able to arrange them for you – depending on whether you’ve any existing health conditions, and your ability to get across the importance of a proactive approach to healthcare!</p>
    <p>Otherwise, I’ve used a private blood testing company, Thriva, and found it simple and easy to do. Their website currently has a 20% off promotion, when you subscribe to their newsletter. Or, if you <a href="https://thriva.co/i/LDYX3BJ8D4A">use this link</a> we both get £20 off our tests. Use whichever gets you the best discount!</p>
    
    <p>If find the following useful every 9-12 months:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>I’m still writing this page!</li>
      <li>The £103 <a href="https://thriva.co/blood-test-packages/mens-health-blood-test">men’s health blood test</a> from Thriva is ideal though</li>
      <li>More detail to follow</li>
