        <h2>Want a healthier body?</h2>
        <h2>Mind getting in the way?</h2>
        <h2>Feeling low on energy?</h2>
        <p>I’ve been there, it sucks – I know!</p>
        <p>I’m here to share with you everything I have learnt in my journey to a happier and healthier life.</p>

        <h2>I can help you</h2>
        <p>Ten years of research and learning has taught me how to sift out misinformation, and how to save you time by guiding you around my mistakes.</p>
        <p>My own use of health and wellness coaches have proven that having this structure in place can significantly accelerate your results.</p>
        <p>I can help you connect the mind and body – <em>to yoke</em> – so they work together, in harmony for long-term health.</p>

        <h2>Initial transformation programme</h2>
        <p>We’ll start with a video call, so I can understand where you’re at, and whether we think we can work together. I’ll tailor the intensity and duration of the initial programme to your goals and support needs, providing you with a personalised plan and one–off cost.</p>
        <p>If you decide to commit to the programme, we’ll get started on your first layer (a term that’ll rapidly become familiar) straight away – and then you’re off!</p>

        <h2>Ongoing progress and support</h2>
        <p>After your initial programme, you’ll have the option to continue with a monthly subscription – guiding you through further layers, reinforcing and enhancing your mindset and habits to result in an ever healthier lifestyle.</p>
        <p>This is typically less intense, but again is personalised to your goals and requirements. We’ll discuss progress and introduce new layers to your programme when ready.</p>

        <h2>Apply now</h2>
        <p>I’ll next be taking on new clients in January 2023.</p>
