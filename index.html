        <h2>Want a healthier body?</h2>
        <h2>Mind getting in the way?</h2>
        <h2>Feeling low on energy?</h2>
        <p>I’ve been there, it sucks – I know!</p>
        <p>I’m here to share with you everything I have learnt in my journey to a happier and healthier life.</p>

        <h2>I can help you</h2>
        <p>At 35, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. Nearly ten years on, I’m lean, strong, sleep well, and <em>no longer require any medications</em>.</p>
        <p>Between then, my weight yo–yo’d significantly. As did my mental health. Life only started to improve when I made a decision – <strong>to ask for help</strong>.</p>
        <p>My own use of health and wellness coaches have proven that having this structure in place can <em>significantly</em> accelerate your results.</p>

        <h2>Save time and money</h2>
        <p>My coaching is based on research and experience. I learnt what works <em>(and what doesn’t)</em> through years of trial and error. You can avoid my mistakes.</p>
        <p>I can guide you around crazy health myths and misinformation. I’ve tried all the fad–diets, life–hacks and expensive supplements – you don’t need to.</p>
        <p>Over <em>just two months</em>, I’ll share with you what I’ve refined into an <strong>easily sustainable lifestyle</strong>. And yes, that means treats are allowed!</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Lose <abbr title="4.5kg">10lbs</abbr> in 2 months</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Join my initial transformation programme, and you’ll get:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weekly group call</strong>
                    – (or video message) to introduce new topics and tasks
                    <em>(with questions/guidance during calls, 10 people max.)</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>24/7 support</strong>
                    – I’ll reply to your questions or progress updates, and nudge you if needed
                    <em>(almost, I do sleep!)</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>New habits</strong>
                    – default healthy actions that, quite quickly, you won’t even think about
                    <em>(just like brushing your teeth)</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Access to my online resources</strong>
                    – self–learning from curated information for those able to put in extra time
                    <em>(accelerates your results)</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Layered progress</strong>
                    – new ideas introduced in the right order, for optimal progress
                    <em>(as the saying goes, “you can’t outrun a bad diet”)</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Daily messages and feedback</strong>
                    – during accountability phases of the programme
                    <em>(you’ll love this!)</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>One–to–one call</strong>
                    – at the end of the programme
                    <em>(to discuss progress and next steps)</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Plus, if you follow my coaching, <strong>I guarantee you’ll lose <abbr title="4.5kg">10lbs</abbr> of fat</strong> over the 2 months. <em>Minimum</em>.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">You’ll graduate with the knowledge and skills to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and the mindset to stick to it.</p>
            <p>All for <u>just £239/month</u>.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Taking it further</h2>
        <p>After graduating, you’ll have the option of a monthly plan – providing <strong>support, accountability and optimisation</strong> of your ongoing progress.</p>
        <p>We’d agree a programme together, either a continuation of group coaching, or a personalised one–to–one accelerator course.</p>
        <p>I’d then guide you through further topics, reinforce and enhance your mindset and habits to result in an ever healthier lifestyle.</p>
        <p>I’m also studying for a nutritional qualification on more advanced/specific topics, to ensure I give you the <em>absolute best advice</em>.</p>

        <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
        <p>Changing your lifestyle isn’t easy, but my job is to help make it <strong>simple and manageable</strong>.</p>
        <p>It requires commitment, honesty and being open to feedback. And of course, <em>making time</em> (4–6 hours/week) to participate fully in the programme.</p>
        <p>Don’t worry about support from troublesome family members, I’ve tips for getting then on your side!</p>
        <p>And, while entirely optional, I recommend a few products and services to boost your results. If you decide to buy them all, they total around £150.</p>

        <h2>Can I afford this?</h2>
        <p>While appreciating these are difficult times, and without wishing to scaremonger, <em>you’re going to spend the money anyway</em>.</p>
        <p>Your <em>choice</em> is whether to <strong>be proactive and do something positive for yourself</strong>, enjoy being able to play with your grandchildren and so on.</p>
        <p>Or sleepwalk into wasting time with GP visits, spending money on hospital parking and prescriptions…</p>

        <h2>Now not a good time?</h2>
        <p>Brilliant! There’s never a perfect time. Life always gets in the way doesn’t it?</p>
        <p>However, learning the skills to <strong>navigate around difficult times</strong> only strengthens making changes a lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Day one, or one day – <em>you decide</em>!</p>

        <h2>Apply now</h2>
        <p>We’ll start with a (free, no–obligation) video call, so I can understand where you’re at, and whether we think we can work together.</p>
        <p>If you decide to commit to the programme, we’ll get started with a couple of preparation steps before my next intake date – <em>and then you’re off!</em></p>
        <p>I’ll next be coaching new clients on <u>15 January 2023</u>.</p>
