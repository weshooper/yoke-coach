      <h3>Want to improve blood test results?</h3>
      <p>This is entirely <strong>optional</strong>. They’re not necessary for the programme, and if your focus is on improving how you look and feel (as it should be!) then I'd simply recommend leaving measurements at that.</p>
      <p>However, for those who’re especially results-driven – if you’re willing, and able, to invest additional time (and perhaps money) – now is a good time to arrange up-to-date <a href="blood-tests">blood tests</a>.</p>
